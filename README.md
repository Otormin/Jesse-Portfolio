# 👨‍💻 Jesse's Portfolio

**A central hub showcasing my journey as a Software Developer, featuring a diverse range of projects in Full Stack Web Development, Machine Learning, and Cloud Computing.**

## 📖 About The Project

This repository hosts the source code for my personal portfolio website. It serves as a comprehensive catalog of my technical skills, demonstrating my ability to build everything from complex backend APIs and machine learning models to interactive JavaScript games and frontend interfaces.

I built this portfolio to be:

* **Clean & Professional:** A minimalist design that puts the code first.
* **Responsive:** Fully optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop viewing.
* **Interactive:** Providing direct links to live demos and code repositories.
